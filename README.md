My personal configs, themes, etc (cuz just installing xfce4 and using it like a normal person is not k3wl enough)

What i use, and why:

--- Workflow ---
* awesomewm
    I like dynamic WM's that heavily rely on tiling
    Tabs-based workflow works great for me, aspecially on separate monitors
    It's configurable
    It's awesome

* i3lock 
+ scrot
+ ImageMagick
    I want to be able to lock my PC :p
    Scrot + ImageMagick is to make it pretteh

* vim
+ vim-fugitive
+ vim-ale
+ vim-airline
+ vim-nerdtree
    It works for me both as a simple text editor and as an IDE.
    All the cuul guys use it.

--- Cosmetics ---
* compton
    Pretty windows

* redshift
    Easy on eyes

* qt5ct
    Choosing themes of Qt apps

* lxappearance
    Choosing themes of GTK apps

--- Anything else ---
It's ever changing. I like thunar though.
