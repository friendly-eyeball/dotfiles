# dotfiles
My personal configs, themes, etc (cuz just installing xfce4 and using it like a normal person is not k3wl enough)

What i use, and why:

--- Workflow ---

* awesomewm

    I like dynamic WM's that heavily rely on tiling. Also, tabs-based workflow works great for me, aspecially on separate monitors.

* i3lock (+ scrot, + ImageMagick, + autolock)

    I want to be able to lock my PC :p


* vim (+ vim-fugitive, vim-ale, vim-airline, vim-nerdtree)

    It works for me both as a simple text editor and as an IDE (and all the cuul guys use it).


--- Cosmetics ---

* compton

    Pretty windows


* redshift

    Easy on eyes


* qt5ct

    Choosing themes of Qt apps


* lxappearance

    Choosing themes of GTK apps


--- Anything else ---

It's ever changing. I like thunar though.
